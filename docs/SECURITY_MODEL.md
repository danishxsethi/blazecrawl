# Security Model

BlazeCrawl Core treats **every user-supplied URL as hostile**. This document
describes the threats and the controls.

## Threats

* **SSRF** — a request to `http://169.254.169.254/...` or `http://10.x/...`
  reaching internal/cloud infrastructure.
* **DNS rebinding / TOCTOU** — DNS returns a public IP at validation time and a
  private IP at connection time.
* **Redirect pivot** — a public URL 302s to an internal address.
* **Protocol downgrade** — `https` → `http` redirect exposing content.
* **Browser-path bypass** — Chromium does its own DNS, bypassing HTTP pinning.
* **Bombs** — oversized or compressed responses exhausting memory.
* **Parser confusion** — userinfo URLs, legacy IP encodings, IPv4-mapped IPv6.

## Browser egress boundary (WP1B/WP2C/WP3-proven)

For browser rendering, Chromium is launched with an explicit loopback HTTP proxy
and an empty bypass list. Every absolute HTTP request and HTTPS CONNECT is
resolved by `network/browser_proxy.py`; all returned addresses are validated
before the proxy opens a socket to the selected IP. The original hostname remains
in the HTTP authority and CONNECT tunnel, so Chromium performs normal SNI and
certificate validation — BlazeCrawl never terminates or inspects TLS (no MITM).
Redirects and subresources therefore re-enter the same boundary. Proxy failures
are fail-closed.

```text
Chromium
→ BrowserEgressProxy (loopback, empty bypass list)
→ Resolver
→ validate complete IP set (all A/AAAA records)
→ numeric socket connection (connect to validated IP only)
```

> Invariant: for every browser-originated outbound request supported by
> BlazeCrawl, the destination socket may connect only to an IP address that has
> passed prohibited-address validation for the corresponding hostname at
> connection time.

### Browser primitives — v0.1 policy

| Primitive               | v0.1 Policy                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP navigation         | Supported / governed (egress boundary)        |
| HTTPS navigation        | Supported / governed (CONNECT, no MITM)       |
| iframe                  | Supported / governed                          |
| image                   | Supported / governed                          |
| script                  | Supported / governed                          |
| CSS/resources           | Supported / governed                          |
| fetch                   | Supported / governed                          |
| XHR                     | Supported / governed                          |
| EventSource             | Supported / governed                          |
| popup                   | Supported / governed                          |
| WebSocket               | Blocked                                       |
| Worker                  | Blocked                                       |
| SharedWorker            | Blocked                                       |
| ServiceWorker           | Blocked                                       |
| WebRTC unrestricted UDP | Prevented/constrained (`disable_non_proxied_udp`) |

"Governed" means the request traverses the browser egress proxy and is subject
to the same hostname/IP validation invariant as top-level navigation. "Blocked"
means the primitive is denied by request interception; these regressions are
covered by `tests/security/test_browser_subresource_isolation.py`.


| Threat | Control | Where |
|---|---|---|
| SSRF | Resolve once, validate EVERY A/AAAA record against the private/reserved denylist; fail closed | `network/ssrf.py` |
| DNS rebinding | Pin the connection to the single validated IP (`sni_hostname` preserves TLS); callers never re-resolve | `network/egress.py` |
| Redirect pivot | Manual redirect following; each hop re-validated + re-pinned | `network/egress.py` |
| Downgrade | `https→http` redirects blocked | `network/egress.py` |
| Browser bypass | Playwright route guard re-validates every request incl. sub-resources + popups | `network/egress.py`, `engine/browser_pool.py` |
| Bombs | `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` streaming cap, per-hop timeouts | `network/egress.py`, `config.py` |
| Parser confusion | Reject userinfo URLs, legacy/hex/decimal/octal IPs, IPv4-mapped IPv6, non-http(s) schemes | `network/ip_utils.py`, `network/ssrf.py` |
| robots abuse | robots.txt enforced; not configurable-off in OSS | `engine/robots.py` |
| WebRTC IP leak | Chromium `--force-webrtc-ip-handling-policy=disable_non_proxied_udp` | `engine/browser_pool.py` |

## Authentication

The API requires a bearer key by default. If `BLAZECRAWL_API_KEY` is unset, a
cryptographically secure key is generated on first start, written to the state
directory (`$BLAZECRAWL_STATE_DIR`, default `~/.local/state/blazecrawl`; inside
Docker `/data/blazecrawl` on a volume) as `api_key` with mode `0600`, and shown
once in the first-run output. Restarts reuse the persisted key silently — the
raw key is not re-printed. Explicitly set `BLAZECRAWL_API_KEY` to use your own
key; it is never persisted or printed. Auth can be disabled only when bound to
loopback with `BLAZECRAWL_AUTH_DISABLED=true` — it is **refused on a routable
bind** so the engine cannot silently become an open proxy.

## Container hardening

The reference `docker-compose.yml` runs both services non-root with
`no-new-privileges`, `cap_drop: ALL`, a read-only root filesystem, and
`tmpfs` for `/tmp` and `/dev/shm`. Only the API-key state directory and the
Redis data directory are writable (volumes). The API publishes to
`127.0.0.1` only; Redis has no host-published port. Note: Chromium currently
runs with `--no-sandbox` because the intended container runtime does not
guarantee unprivileged user namespaces; BlazeCrawl itself is **not** a
security sandbox — isolate untrusted crawling workloads with containers/VMs
as appropriate for your threat model.
