"""Shared SSRF-safe egress layer (M2 / C-1).

Every fetch of a user-controlled URL MUST go through this module so the
DNS-rebinding / TOCTOU fix lives in exactly one place.

Two mechanisms are provided:

1. ``PinnedAsyncClient`` — an httpx-based async client that:
     * validates + pins the target IP via :func:`validate_and_pin` (resolve once),
     * connects the socket to the EXACT validated IP (never re-resolves), while
       preserving the original hostname for the Host header and TLS SNI/cert
       validation,
     * follows redirects MANUALLY, re-validating + re-pinning every hop and
       blocking cross-scheme downgrades and redirects to blocked hosts.

2. Helper accessors (``curl_resolve_entries`` / ``host_resolver_rules`` re-exported
   from :mod:`ssrf`) for the curl_cffi and headless-browser paths, which do their
   own DNS and therefore need their own pin.

Fail closed: if a target cannot be validated and pinned, we raise
:class:`SSRFValidationError` rather than fall back to an unpinned fetch.

# M9 — SSRF-safe egress THROUGH a proxy
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Routing a fetch through a proxy changes the network mechanics but MUST NOT
# weaken the M2 SSRF guarantees. The guarantees are preserved as follows:
#
#   1. TARGET VALIDATION IS UNCONDITIONAL. Before every hop we call
#      validate_and_pin(target) exactly as the direct path does. A proxied
#      request to an internal/blocked target (or a proxied redirect to one) is
#      refused with SSRFValidationError — the proxy can never be used as an SSRF
#      pivot to RFC-1918 / loopback / link-local / cloud-metadata ranges.
#
#   2. THE PROXY ENDPOINT ITSELF IS VALIDATED. We resolve+classify the proxy
#      host and refuse a proxy that points at an internal range, so a
#      misconfigured/hostile proxy URL cannot tunnel us inside the perimeter.
#
#   3. NETWORK-ISOLATION ASSUMPTION (documented + enforced-in-depth). With an
#      HTTP/HTTPS proxy the proxy performs the final DNS + connect to the target
#      host, so we cannot pin the *socket* to our validated IP the way the
#      direct path does. The residual gap (proxy re-resolves the host) is closed
#      by (a) always validating the host's resolution ourselves immediately
#      before the call — an attacker controlling DNS still has to present a
#      public IP to OUR resolver — and (b) the operational requirement that
#      egress proxies run OUTSIDE the trusted network with no route to internal
#      services. Both are required; neither alone is sufficient. We fail closed
#      if target validation fails for any reason.
